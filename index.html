<h2>Block Quote Example</h2>

<p>Below is a snippet from a poem by the great Irish poet W. B. Yeats, using a header and paragraphs within the block quote, because that is perfectly allowable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Extract from 'Among School Children'</h3>

  <p>O chestnut tree, great rooted blossomer,<br />
  Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?<br />
  O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,<br />
  How can we know the dancer from the dance?</p>

  <p>- W. B. Yeats</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(notice the use of explicit line-breaks within a paragrpah)</p>
